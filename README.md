# School District Analysis Using Panda

## Overview of Project

To analyze the effect of removing suspected doctored data and seeing the results on school district data analysis.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to remove Thomas High School 9th grade Math and Reading score from the data and analyzing the results of the removal on the overall analysis of the data across different metrics and factors.

## Results

- District Summary

Removing Thomas High School District 9th grade data has an effect of lowering average math scores by about 0.1, the passing math percentage by about 0.2%, passing reading percentage by about 0.1% and overall passing percentage by 0.3%. The average reading score change was too slight in the data. We can conclude that overall, the removed data had slightly increased the overall numbers in the district summary.

- School Summary

When looking at how Thomas High School data changed in the school summary, we can see that the Thomas High School numbers dropped in terms of math score and percentage of students passing across the board, with reading being a notable exception. Average math score for Thomas High School dropped by about 0.07, average reading score increased by about 0.05 and math, reading and overall percentage dropped by about 0.09, 0.29 and 0.32 respectively.

- Thomas High Schoolâ€™s Performance Relative to the Other Schools

Interestingly enough, even though most of Thomas High School's numbers dropped, Thomas High School still was able to maintain its position as the 2nd best school in terms of overall passing percentage, still surpassing Griffin High School by 0.03%. Even with lower numbers in almost all areas, Thomas High School still maintains a very strong performance relative to the other schools in the data.

- Math and Reading Scores by Grade

New Reading Score Average by Grade

The only clear change here is that we can see that the Thomas High School 9th grade scores have been removed from the data. Other than that, we can assume that the average math and reading scores for all 9th graders overall dropped, since Thomas High School 9th grade scores were on the higher end compareed to other schools' 9th grade scores.

- Scores by school spending

The removal of the Thomas High School 9th grade scores were not significant enough to affect the formatted data for school spending.

## Summary

Overall, removing the Thomas High School 9th grade scores had negatively affected math scores, math passing percentage and reading passing percentage across board, with reading score being the only metric to improve. Otherwise, the removal of the data was not significant enough to affect Thomas High School's relative performance, School Spending metrics, School Size metrics, or School Type metrics. The change to the data on a surface level were very slight, although more analysis would have to be made whether the removal of 461 students in a dataset of 39170 students was statistically significant or not. Without further statistical analysis, the conclusion to be made would be the removal of the Thomas High School 9th grade scores did not significantly change any of the conclusions that could have been made with the data included.
